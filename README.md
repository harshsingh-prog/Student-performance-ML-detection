## Project Title: Student Performance Analysis

### Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of student performance using various machine learning models. The project aims to understand and predict the performance of students and schools based on different parameters. The machine learning models used in this project include:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Simple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

### Repository Structure

The repository includes the following Jupyter Notebook files:

1. **Untitled 6.ipynb**:
   - **Data Visualization**: Exploratory data analysis and visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare the data for modeling.

2. **Untitled 7.ipynb**:
   - **Model Training**: Implementation and training of the KNN and Decision Tree models.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation of the models' performance using appropriate metrics.

3. **Untitled 9.ipynb**:
   - **Regression Models**: Implementation and training of Simple Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation of the regression models' performance.

### Installation

To run the notebooks, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <repository_directory>
```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the desired notebook (e.g., `Untitled 6.ipynb`) to explore data visualization, preprocessing, and model training steps.

### Project Workflow

1. **Data Visualization and Preprocessing** (Untitled 6.ipynb):
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Perform data visualization to understand the data distribution and relationships.
   - Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing the data.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation** (Untitled 7.ipynb and Untitled 9.ipynb):
   - Implement KNN and Decision Tree models.
   - Train the models on the preprocessed data.
   - Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Implement Simple Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models.
   - Train and evaluate the regression models.

### Results

The results and performance metrics of each model are documented in the respective Jupyter Notebooks. The project provides insights into which models perform best for predicting student performance based on the given dataset.
